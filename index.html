				I remember the day I chose computing as my career path like it was yesterday. It was the start of the school year 2001. As I walked into the building I noticed two brand new glorious PCs standing in the hall. A couple of pupils were already standing there, surfing the web. I went up to them and gazed at the beautiful curved (convex) displays. I was hooked. I knew PCs but I never saw someone just nonchalantly browsing. Before that moment, I wanted to pursue a medical career but after seeing someone around my age using a PC, I knew I wanted to have technology in my life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, I would describe myself as someone passionate about Java, keen on minimalistic approaches and enthralled by modern architecture. I'm someone who appreciates clean code highly. It's like a round, perfectly sanded piece of wood. It takes good craftsmanship to create and it's satisfying to marvel at the result.

				Following up, you'll find short summaries about each of my career and academic steps in my life so far, and of course, at the bottom, my contact information.

			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">09.2010 - 01.2015</span><span class="occupation">ACL advanced commerce labs GmbH<br/>Software Development</span></h3>
					<p>At ACL (formerly JCL eCommerce GmbH) I gained my first experience as a professional developer. As part of a small team, we developed backend eCommerce solutions for our customers. Major parts of the stack used included a Java webservice running within a Tomcat, connected to DB2 and MySQL databases, with a servlet based frontend for our inhouse customer service. Additionally, developing asynchronous jobs managed with Automic were part of my daily work.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">02.2015 - 04.2018</span><span class="occupation">KNAPP Systemintegration GmbH<br/>Project Development</span></h3>
					<p>In my 3 years in the project development department, I was a part of different teams developing customer specific additions and changes of the warehouse management system, a JEE application running within a Wildfly. I've learned how JEE containers, injection mechanism, message queueing and ORM (incl. JPQL) work in practice. Thanks to the architects of the teams, who always took the time to teach me the nitty gritty details, I managed to improve my skills drastically.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">04.2018 - present</span><span class="occupation">KNAPP Systemintegration GmbH<br/>Product Development</span></h3>
					<p>With the experience I gained in the project development team, I switched to the product development team for our warehouse management system. In a small team we continue to implement new features, enhance the core concepts and develop new tooling that will aid the project development teams. We introduced git (switched from svn) and docker container, upgraded our Java version multiple times and enhanced the stability of our products through a improved CI.<br/>
					While being part of the product development team I studied part-time at FH Joanneum where I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Design.</p>

			<h2>Education</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">09.2004 - 05.2009</span><span class="occupation">HTBLA Kaindorf a. d. Sulm<br/>EDV und Organisation</span></h3>
					<p>I have fond memories of my time in the higher technical college. It sparked my joy for programming and I fell in love with Java. Not so much with JSF but thankfully that framework didn't take off. The foundation I got from attending this school was the perfect start for my technical career.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">10.2017 - 02.2021</span><span class="occupation">FH Joanneum<br/>Software Design</span></h3>
					<p>After 8 years away from a formal education I decided it was time to pursue a new goal. I chose Software Design for two reasons. Firstly, the curriculum seemed interesting as software designs and architectures are topics I want to further develop my skills in and secondly, it was part-time. I didn't want to shift my main focus on academics, I wanted to add an academic background to my skills.<br/>
					I wrote my first bachelor's thesis about the applied usage of the Criteria API, a type-safe alternative to JPQL. Feel free to check out <a href="https://familieschmid.at/t1" print="familieschmid.at/t1">my thesis</a> and the associated <a href="https://familieschmid.at/c1" print="familieschmid.at/c1">code</a>. This prototype also includes a code generator for a saveer and more convinient way to initialise and persist entities. For my second bachelor's thesis I chose the topic machine learning. I created a prototype that uses reinforcement learning to solve a variant of the bin packing problem. Again, feel free to read through <a href="https://familieschmid.at/t2" print="familieschmid.at/t2">my second thesis</a> or take a look at my <a href="https://familieschmid.at/c2" print="familieschmid.at/c2">prototype</a>.
